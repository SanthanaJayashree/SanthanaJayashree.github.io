Hello world, I'm Jayashree 👋

I'm a technical writer with a passion for crafting quality documentation and learning all things technical writing-related.

Here are a few things about me and what I'm doing lately:

✍️ I am a workaholic who loves to create documentation in my free time just for fun! 

🌱 I am a lover of learning, and I'm currently teaching myself Git.
